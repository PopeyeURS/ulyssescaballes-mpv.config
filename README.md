# 🎥 Ulysses' MPV Configuration

**Artifact-free. Vivid. Cinematic.**  
This is my personal `mpv.conf`, refined through countless iterations to achieve playback that’s both technically precise and aesthetically faithful. Every frame is tuned for realism, depth, and clarity—without compromise.

## 🧭 Philosophy

This config isn’t just about suppressing artifacts—it’s about honoring the source. It reflects a balance between technical rigor and visual sensitivity:

- ✅ **Tone Mapping**: `bt.2390` with contrast recovery for natural highlight roll-off and lifelike skin tones  
- 🧠 **Sharpening**: Controlled, halo-free sharpening that enhances detail without edge ringing  
- 🌈 **Debanding & Dithering**: Fade-aware debanding and fruit dithering for smooth gradients and cinematic fades  
- 🧪 **GPU API**: Tuned for Vulkan, with fallback stability on D3D11  
- 🗣️ **Subtitles**: Styled for legibility and visual harmony

## 📂 Installation

Place `mpv.conf` in your MPV config directory:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\mpv\`
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/mpv/`

If you use modular profiles (e.g., `anime.conf`, `film.conf`), include them in the same directory and load them via command-line or profile switching.

## 🧰 Optional Add-ons

If you want to extend this setup:

- `shaders.glsl`: Custom shader sequences for genre-specific realism  
- `gpu.conf`: Vulkan-specific overrides  
- `subs.conf`: Subtitle styling presets

## 🤝 Sharing the Philosophy

This config is meant to be shared, forked, and adapted. Whether you're chasing artifact-free playback or just want a solid baseline, feel free to use it as a foundation. I welcome feedback, questions, and collaboration.

## 🪞 Final Word

Playback perfection isn’t just about numbers—it’s about how it feels. This config reflects my journey toward that feeling. If it helps you get closer to yours, then it’s done its job.
